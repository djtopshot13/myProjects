# NHLFantasyAssistant Software Documentation
My main objective is to try and create a program that optimizes user performance in ESPN Fantasy NHL. 
I have a rough draft project functioning, but I hope to use an LLM to assist users.
The LLM would help offer suggestions for making decisions with adding, dropping, trading, starting, and benching their players.
I would love to make this into an app that displays the same ESPN Fantasy App with additional prompts and tools surrounding the normal app. 

## Requirements
\*This will be done later to figure out exactly what I am hoping to create.
