# **NHLFantasyAssistant Software Documentation**
## **Purpose and Objectives**
- My main objective is to try and create a program that optimizes user performance within ESPN Fantasy NHL. 
- I have a rough draft project functioning that generates reports that the user can read to help their decision making.
- My end goal would be to use an LLM to parse these reports and generate possible decisions filtering from best to worst. 
- The LLM would help offer suggestions for making decisions with adding, dropping, trading, starting, and benching their players.
- I would love to make this into an app that displays the same ESPN Fantasy App with additional prompts and tools surrounding the normal app or an extension of some sort if that is not feasible.
